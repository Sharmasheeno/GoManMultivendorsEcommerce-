## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (or npm/yarn)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or npm install
# or yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following variables. **This file should NOT be committed to Git.**

```env
# PostgreSQL Database Connection URL from your database provider
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?sslmode=require"

# Clerk Authentication Keys (get these from your Clerk dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Other keys if you have them
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the Prisma migration command to sync your database schema and create the necessary tables.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```
Optionally, you can seed your database if you have a seed script:
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Now you can start the development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
# or npm run dev
# or yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2.  **Import Project on Vercel:** Import your GitHub repository into Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js project.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables:** In your Vercel project's settings, go to the **Environment Variables** section. Add all the variables from your `.env` file (`DATABASE_URL`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, etc.).
    * **Important:** Vercel will securely inject these variables during the build process. This is the correct way to handle secrets for deployment.
4.  **Deploy:** Trigger a new deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your application.
